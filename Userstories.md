As a player,
I want to score a point when the Christmas ornament (ball) passes my opponent’s paddle,

Acceptance Criteria:

When the ball passes an opponent’s paddle, the game should increment the player’s score by one point.
A festive sound effect (e.g., jingle bells or a "Ho Ho Ho!") should play whenever a point is scored, and the score must update visibly on the screen.

User Story 4: Player Experiences Christmas Power-Ups
As a player,
I want to collect special Christmas-themed power-ups,
So that I can temporarily enhance my gameplay with unique abilities (e.g., larger paddle, slower ball speed).

Acceptance Criteria:

Power-ups (such as a "Snowball" that freezes the ball or a "Gift Box" that enlarges the paddle) should appear randomly during gameplay.
The player must be able to collect a power-up by passing over it with the paddle, and the power-up should last for a limited time, with clear visual effects (e.g., glowing or sparkling).

When the game ends, a Christmas-themed "Game Over" screen should appear, complete with snowflakes, a decorated tree, and the option to "Play Again" or "Exit to North Pole."
The game-over screen must display the final score and show a congratulatory message such as “Merry Christmas, Player 1 Wins!”
