Part 1: Unit Testing the Game Mechanics
Description:
Unit tests ensure that the core mechanics of the game (such as movement, collision detection, and score calculation) work as expected in isolation.

Action:
Movement: Ensure the paddle moves as expected with user input.
Collision Detection: Ensure the ball bounces off walls and paddles correctly.
Ball Reset: Ensure the ball resets to the center after scoring a point.
Unit Test Cases:
Test Case	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Paddle Movement (Player 1)	Player presses UP, DOWN keys	Paddle moves up/down within the screen boundaries
Paddle Movement (Player 2)	Player 2 presses UP, DOWN keys	Paddle moves up/down within the screen boundaries
Ball Bouncing Off Paddle	Ball hits paddle while moving towards it	Ball should bounce back in the opposite direction with appropriate speed
Ball Bouncing Off Top/Bottom	Ball hits top or bottom wall	Ball should reverse its Y direction
Ball Reset After Scoring	Ball passes a paddle	Ball should reset to center of the screen with a visual effect (snowfall, Christmas sound)
Christmas Ornament Ball	Ball collision with paddle	The ball should remain in the Christmas ornament form, bouncing properly
Part 2: Logic Testing the Game Rules and Calculations
Description:
Logic tests ensure that the game rules and score calculations work as expected and produce the correct results.

Action:
Score Calculation: Ensure the score is updated correctly after each point is scored.
Speed Increase: Ensure the game speed increases correctly with the player's score or level.
Bonus Points for Power-Ups: Ensure power-ups work correctly and apply score multipliers or other bonuses.
Logic Test Cases:
Test Case	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Score Calculation	Player scores a point	Score should increase by 1 for each point scored
Level Progression	Player reaches 10 points	Speed should increase by 15% after 10 points
Power-Up Bonus	Player collects a power-up	Score multiplier should apply, e.g., double points for 10 seconds
Max Score	Score reaches 9999	Score remains at 9999 and is decorated with a gold frame
Bonus Points for Clearing 4 Lines	Player clears 4 lines (Tetris event)	Score should increase by 800 points and a special animation should trigger
Part 3: Boundary Testing: Edge Cases and Limits
Description:
Boundary testing ensures that the game handles extreme or rare cases (like maximum score, multiple lines cleared, maximum speed, etc.).

Action:
Maximum Score: Test if the game can handle the maximum score correctly.
Clearing Multiple Lines: Test if the game handles clearing multiple lines correctly.
Edge Collisions: Ensure the game stops movement correctly when pieces touch the boundary.
Boundary Test Cases:
Test Case	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Max Score	Score reaches 9999	Score should remain at 9999 with a gold frame around it
Clearing Multiple Lines	Player clears 4 lines	Score should increase by 800 and trigger special Tetris effects
Ball at Boundary	Ball moves to the far left/right	Ball should stop at the edge and reverse direction
Paddle at Boundary	Paddle at top or bottom	Paddle should not move beyond the top or bottom of the screen
High Speed	Player reaches level 10	Speed should be constant at level 10 and no issues with game performance
Part 4: Integration Testing: System Interaction
Description:
Integration testing ensures that all components of the game (UI, mechanics, scoring, etc.) work together correctly.

Action:
Gameplay and Scoring: Verify that the game updates the score after clearing lines or scoring points.
Movement and Collision: Verify that player movement interacts with obstacles, boundaries, and paddles.
Menus and Gameplay: Ensure the game starts properly from the menu and resets correctly after the game ends.
Integration Test Cases:
Test Case	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Gameplay and Scoring	Player clears a line	Score should update and the line should disappear from the grid
Movement and Collision	Player moves paddle and hits ball	Ball should bounce correctly off the paddle
Menus and Gameplay	Player clicks “Start Game”	Game should transition to the gameplay screen with Christmas effects
Reset After Game Over	Player loses the game	Game should reset, display the "Game Over" screen, and offer a restart option
Power-Up and Gameplay Integration	Player collects power-up	The power-up effect should apply immediately, and gameplay should continue without disruption
Part 5: Handling Bad Input and Run-Time Errors
Description:
This testing ensures that the game handles invalid input and runtime errors gracefully.

Action:
Invalid Key Input: Ensure the game ignores or handles invalid key presses correctly.
Unexpected Game States: Test how the game reacts to unexpected conditions (e.g., the grid is unexpectedly empty).
Error Handling: Test how the game responds to errors, such as corrupted save files.
Bad Input Test Cases:
Test Case	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Invalid Key Input	Player presses a non-mapped key	Game should ignore the input and not crash
Multiple Key Presses	Player presses multiple conflicting keys	Game should process only one valid input and ignore conflicting inputs
Corrupted Save File	Corrupt save data	Game should notify the player and allow them to start a new game
Server Loss (for online play)	Server connection is lost	Game should notify the player and return to the main menu
Unexpected State	Empty grid after level completion	Game should reset or show an error and continue normally
