1. App Idea
Pong is a classic two-player arcade game where players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game will retain its retro charm while offering modern updates like customizable paddles, ball speeds, and gameplay modes, making it fun for both nostalgic players and newcomers to the arcade genre.

2. Target Audience
Pong is designed for a broad audience, appealing to players of all ages, particularly those between 8 and 40 years old who enjoy casual, competitive gaming experiences. It will attract both retro gaming enthusiasts who remember the original and younger players who are looking for simple but engaging multiplayer games. This game will also appeal to those who enjoy arcade-style competition and games with a low learning curve.

3. Goals and Vision
The primary goal is to recreate the nostalgic feel of the original Pong while adding new features and polish to appeal to modern gamers. We want to create an accessible, competitive, and replayable game that can be enjoyed in short sessions with friends or family. The project aims to:
Bring the joy of simple yet engaging gameplay to a new generation.
Foster local multiplayer competition, making it easy for two players to pick up and play anywhere.
Incorporate subtle visual and audio updates while staying true to the iconic aesthetic.

4. Key Features
Multiplayer Mode: Two-player local multiplayer (split-screen or side-by-side play).
Classic & Modern Modes: Players can choose between the original Pong gameplay or a more modernized version with adjustable ball speeds and paddles.
Customizable Gameplay: Options for adjusting difficulty, ball speed, and paddle size.
Retro Aesthetic: Classic pixel art and simple, bright visuals that echo the look and feel of the original Pong game.
Sound Design: Authentic 8-bit sound effects, with the option to toggle on/off or customize.
Leaderboards: Track high scores for competitive players to challenge each other.
Cross-Platform Play (Optional): Support for various devices (PC, mobile, console) if feasible, allowing players on different platforms to compete.

5. Success Criteria
The game will be considered successful if it:
Operates without major bugs or performance issues, delivering smooth gameplay.
Appeals to both retro gaming fans and new players by offering intuitive, accessible gameplay with enough competitive depth.
Provides a fun and engaging experience for quick play sessions, and has replay value through the leaderboard system.
Receives positive feedback in terms of nostalgia, entertainment value, and overall gameplay satisfaction.

6. Technical Requirements

Controls:
PC: Keyboard (arrow keys or WASD for paddle movement).
Mobile: Touchscreen controls for paddle movement (drag/swipe).
Performance: The game should run smoothly at 60 FPS or higher on a wide range of devices, including low-end mobile phones and older computers.

Save System: The game will allow players to save their high scores locally or in the cloud for tracking and leaderboard purposes.
